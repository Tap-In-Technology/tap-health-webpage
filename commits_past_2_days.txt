3d6e01b7 - Aris Vetter, 3 minutes ago : Keep large visual margins while preventing extra scrollable space
SOLUTION: Maintain the desired visual spacing (200px margins) while preventing excessive scrollable height:

1. RESTORED large margins (200px) for visual design
2. ADDED negative margin (-400px) to landing section to 'pull back' extra space
3. KEPT scroll boundary prevention at 95% as backup

RESULT:
- ✅ Large visual margins preserved for design
- ✅ No extra scrollable space beyond intended end
- ✅ Natural scrolling behavior maintained
- ✅ Best of both worlds: visual spacing + proper scroll behavior

This approach keeps the luxurious spacing you want while preventing the page from being artificially taller than needed.

1620782d - Aris Vetter, 2 days ago : Fix button selector issue for Go Back to Get in Touch transition
- Problem: Multiple buttons had onclick='goBackToDefault()' (Cancel buttons + main Go Back button)

- Added fallback logic that also excludes phone-form-button class
